Following this, the AI presented two questions regarding the zebras' stripes: whether the user wanted the traditional black and white pattern or a custom color scheme, and whether the stripes should cover the entire background or just a specific section. The user then requested to change the background to dark red. The AI acknowledged this and, in its next interaction, posed questions about the dark red background, asking if the user preferred a solid dark red or a gradient, and whether the change should apply to the entire app or specific sections.\n\nAdditionally, the AI provided a checklist of potential features for the user to consider for implementation. The features included a theme toggle for light and dark mode (checked), customizable background color settings (unchecked), animated background transitions (unchecked), adaptive color schemes for text and buttons (checked), a preview mode for real-time changes (checked), and saving user preferences for background color and theme (checked). The AI confirmed that it was working on changing the background to dark red and then asked the user to describe the project in more detail.",
